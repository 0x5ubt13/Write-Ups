## Categories

## Feedback

The CTF's overall atmosphere was really positive and the infrastructure was excellent. I personally enjoyed the OSINT and the Pwn challenges the most, but all the rest  categories were also fun to try and complete the challenges and learn from them.

Thank you [ENUSEC](https://enusec.org) organisers for all the fun and knowledge I had in just 3 days whilst participating and for one whole week and a half after it was finished trying to do this write-up in my free time.

I can't wait for the next to come!
