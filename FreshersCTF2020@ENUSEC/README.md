# Freshers CTF 2020 

Welcome to my write-up on the first CTF I've participated thoroughly.

## Categories

There have been 8 categories for this CTF:

* Web
* Rev
* Boot 2 Root
* Crypto
* Pwn
* OSINT
* Misc
* [Marios WebApp Playground](./Mario_WebApp_Playground)

The CTF's overall atmosphere was really positive and the infrastructure was excellent. I personally enjoyed the OSINT and the Pwn challenges the most, but all the rest  categories were also fun to try and complete the challenges and learn from them.

Thank you [ENUSEC](https://enusec.org) organisers for all the fun and knowledge I had in just 3 days whilst participating and for one whole week and a half after it being finished trying to do this write-up in my free time.
