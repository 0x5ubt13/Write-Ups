# Robots go Beep	

## Problem

We are given a website with a big robot in it and nothing else. Well, the hint is pretty obvious, isn't it?

If this isn't obvious for you because you are barely starting, wikipedia says [robots.txt, is a standard used by websites to communicate with web crawlers and other web robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard)

# Solution

We only need to check /robots.txt to follow the clue.

Another hint, this time about the sitemap! We know what to do, don't we? [Wiki site about sitemaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_map)
